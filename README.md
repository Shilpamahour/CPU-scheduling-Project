# CPU-scheduling-Project
Description
With the help of this project, users will be able to simulate several CPU scheduling algorithms and assess how well they perform. Numerous well-known scheduling algorithms are implemented, including Round Robin, SJF (Shortest Job First), SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First), FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), and LJF (Longest Job First).
